# Untrusted

## Story

_**Untrusted —or— the Continuing Adventures of Dr. Eval**_ is an
exciting Meta-JavaScript Adventure Game wherein you guide the dashing,
steadfast Dr. Eval through a mysterious MACHINE CONTINUUM, wherein,
using only his trusty computer and the TURING-COMPLETE power of
JavaScript, he must literally ALTER HIS REALITY in order to find his
freedom! You must literally edit and re-execute the very JavaScript
running the game in your browser to save Dr. Eval from this dark and
confusing reality!

> _**Untrusted**_ is an extremely clever game created by Alex Nisnevich and
  Greg Shuflin. Enjoy!

The adventure begins [here](https://codecoolbase.github.io/javascript-workshop---untrusted/).

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn and practice the following topics:

- writing JavaScript,
- solving puzzles,
- some hacking,
- altering the environment of your own code.

## Tasks

1. Solve levels 1-5 as an introductory exercise.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 01 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 02 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 03 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 04 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 05 solvable.

2. Solve levels 6-10 by defining clever callbacks
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 06 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 07 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 08 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 09 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 10 solvable.

3. Solve levels 11-13 by adding some AI
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 11 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 12 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 13 solvable.

4. [OPTIONAL] Solve levels 14-18 by hacking the game deeper and deeper
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 14 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 15 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 16 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 17 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 18 solvable.

5. [OPTIONAL] Solve levels 19-21 by immersing in the code
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 19 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 20 solvable.
    - Inserting the corresponding snippet(s) from `solutions.js` into the blanks renders level 21 solvable.

## General requirements

- The solutions for each level are in separate commits

## Hints

- From the original `README`: "The game presents you with a
  roguelike-like playing environment and a console window with the
  JavaScript code generating each level. As loaded, each level is
  unbeatable, and most of the JavaScript is blocked from editing. The
  challenge is to open a path to the next level using only the limited
  tools left open to you."
- On the first page just start moving, pick up the "computer", and a
  source code will appear on the right. This code is used to generate
  the page setup you are thrown into. Read the comments thoroughly. You
  cannot solve the level as it pops up, so try to modify the parts you
  are allowed to. You can execute the modified code by hitting `Ctrl+5`.
- If your modifications are clever enough, the level becomes easily
  solvable. This requires a good understanding of the displayed source
  code, a good command of JavaScript, and sometimes (mainly on higher
  levels) you also need to know and use the broader API of the game's
  framework (`Ctrl+1`). Keep in mind that completely different
  approaches may lead to success.
- The puzzles get increasingly harder and harder, and often need
  out-of-the-box thinking. If you feel stuck, don't lose heart, give it
  a break and return to the problem later. You're not supposed to finish
  the entire game within one week, especially not the hardest levels.
- The solutions (and multiple solutions) for each level can be found in
  the original repository: <https://github.com/AlexNisnevich/untrusted>.
  Please, for your own sake, do not check them until you have your own
  solution committed and pushed. After that, for your own sake again,
  please check them! :)
- IMPORTANT! Use Git properly and commit your solutions one by one. Only
  atomic commits can be accepted. Use the menu (`Ctrl+0`) to go back to
  an earlier level and solution.
